#	B. Calculate Z-scores

#	Note: To perform the Z-score analysis, count.combined files are merged into a table, and columns corresponding with no-serum controls are summed in a column called “input”.


#	Create table like ...
#	~/testing/counts_vir3_Bio_Protocol.csv 
#	id,S148,S150,S154,S156,input
#	1,0,4,1,0,4
#	2,39,55,58,41,266
#	3,0,4,7,0,18
#	4,6,15,10,9,48
#	5,86,71,85,93,346
#	6,0,4,5,4,12
#	7,54,59,44,77,5
#	8,5,11,6,9,31
#	9,1,0,3,0,7
